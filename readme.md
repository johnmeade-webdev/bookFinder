BookFinder

This project is part of a pre-work requirement for Chingu Voyage 8. At a minimum, the task was to complete a book finder web application that draws from the google books api. A search bar, along with displayed results (title, author, publisher), and a link to further information must be included.

To add more functionality, I have added a 'shelf' for users to access. Each result from a search includes an 'add to shelf' tab that, when clicked, adds the book to the users localStorage. This allows the user's shelf to persist without use of a formal back end.

The web app is meant to be functional, elegant, and straight forward on each device which accesses it.
